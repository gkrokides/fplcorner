HOW TO UPDATE NEW SEASON DATA

1. Create the Season.
This has to be done manually. It's a two-step process
	1. Create the new season and mark it as current
	2. Open the previous season and un-mark it as current

2. Update the teams.
"python manage.py update_teams"
* A lot of information is not included this year (i.e played, points, wins, losses e.t.c) but these fields are included in the db in case they start reporting them.
